##Why most programmers need an alternate operating system and how you should go about getting one

So, if you are reading this on a laptop or a desktop computer, I can say with 98.98 percent surety that you are using a version of either the Windows or Mac `operating system`. 

Generally, a single operating system is sufficient for most computer users. But when you are developing software for multiple operating systems, or using you're computer for things like making a web server, or running very specific development environments, often one operating system ceases to be enough.

Running more than one operating system on a computer or `dual-booting` as it is usually called ( or triple-boot, quad-boot, etc, although the word usage is not as common as dual-boot) is actually very simple and easy, but if you fail to follow some basic procedures, you could end up losing your data, or being unable to use even one OS. Even more terrible things, depending on how bad you screw up.

However operating systems need not always be *installed*. More on `Virtualization` later.

Here are some questions you will most probably have if you are new to installing operating systems : 

###1) Which OS should I install?

You should install whatever operating system best suits your particular programming requirements. Windows and OSX are generally best suited for app and software development for those platforms. For most other things, `linux` flavours are popular. If you simply want to install a linux OS, I would personally reccommend either `Ubuntu` or `Debian`. Both have easy installations, great support bases, lots of software and applications, and a modern UI. 

In the end it comes down simply to what best fits your comfort zone. The Mac OS is better suited for programming than Windows. But neither of these are as popular as open-source linux distros.

###2) Are there any precautions I should take before trying to install a new OS.

**Yes!** As I mentioned before, you might murder your computer by accident when installing an OS, so always take a backup of all you data onto ANOTHER COMPUTER or a HARD DISK.
