##Why most programmers need an alternate operating system and how you should go about getting one

So, if you are reading this on a laptop or a desktop computer, I can say with 98.98 percent surety that you are using a version of either the Windows or Mac operating system. 

Generally, a single operating system is sufficient for most computer users. But when you are developing software for multiple operating systems, or using you're computer for things like making a web server, or running very specific development environments, often one operating system ceases to be enough.

Running more than one operating system on a computer or dual-booting as it is usually called ( or triple-boot, quad-boot, etc, although the word usage is not as common as dual-boot) is actually very simple and easy, but if you fail to follow some basic procedures, you could end up losing your data, or being unable to use even one OS.
