###Hello World :D


I've often wondered about the ramifications of starting a blog. Wittily penning down my personal life for the amusement of readers has never appealed to my conscience. I always wanted to start a purely technical blog, but never found a good enough way. Fortunately or unfortunately, I am one of those people who love the tools more than the creations made by those tools. After experimenting with Blogger, tweaking around with WordPress and Weebly, I finally discovered my new love `Jekyll` on the best website for any one who calls themselves an open-source developer - *Github.*


*And he said*

Finally, a way to make a beautiful blog, without being bogged down by the clutter of databases and brain-freezingly slow layout managers!  With a small learning curve and lots of room for experimentation, `Jekyll` provides enough challenges to be an interesting tool and at the same time remaining stable enough to not eat out my nuerons every time I need to write out a post. I am finally able to do what I've always wanted to do : **Go crazy with words under the pretense of writing a Technical Blog**.
