###***The notes of a newbie front-end web developer on developing web sites for the first time, in the era of responsive, mobile friendly, cross-platform, delight-to-the-eyes design***

I first came across HTML in school, and was totally into it from the start. This was HTML designing using no CSS and certainly no Javascript. The syllabus had us using tags and attributes for everything, even to set font color.

{% highlight html %}

<p> <font size="8" color="aliceblue"> Hello World </font> </p>

{% endhighlight %}

Any complex layouts required fine knowledge of the `<table>` tag. Instead of hex-colors and rgb values, we had to use **named** colors, and as insane as it sounds, this was in 2012.

2 years later: **Enter Codecademy.**

The HTML and CSS track on Codecademy kickstarted my web-design projects. After finishing the Codecademy course, I started small projects of my own. I have decided to write a series of articles on how it feels to start using modern web development tools, fresh off the block from learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The articles will also serve as tutorials to help other newbie web developers.
